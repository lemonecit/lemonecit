# Welcome to my github page


I work today for small electronics company in Israel. 
Hopefully will be one day to return for me to programming area after the course at university.

I am based in Holon, outside of Tel Aviv, Israel.

Since 2021 I decided to do a try to study again after many years because it is so many new things to need learn that I have missed  a lot!

###What I am now focusing on
To finish my studies!
To find work after the studies!
To learn new things!
